# music-scales

Hello coders!

This exercise was my first Reddit Daily Programmer Challenge  (https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7hhyin/20171204_challenge_343_easy_major_scales). It appealed to me because I'm a musician, so the logic of what the program was trying to do was easy for me to understand.
